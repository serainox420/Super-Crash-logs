# Super-Crash-logs

EDIT: Actually found earlier logs, uploading whole folder.

Long story short.
My minecraft 1.17.1 Aristois got supercrashed apparently as nothing would fix the issue, including dumping .minecraft, reinstalling launcher and fabric.

Logs are given numbers as to order in which they happened.

First log is probabbly the one I got straight after crash happened, second after .minecraft removal, third after launcher reinstall and final after fabric update.

There are two more final logs to give some context.
Launcher terminal output log and Client terminal output log with debug included. both taken recently to paint a picture.

Im not expecting anyone to help me fix it as I bet its as easy as dumping whole /home/ folder in which .minecraft sits in, reinstalling and putting home back to place except all files to replace obiously.

Whole point is to analyse it trougly to determine if:
- Its me who's dumb
 
- It had something to do with recent mojang exploit (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition)
- as it happened within short time frames betwen. 
- Which could effectively make it one time event, still interesting and worth noting.

- It could also be reproducable and persistent, which would mean huge exploit in one or many different things
- (Fabric, Aristois, Alto Clef, Baritone, JS Macros) was running at the time, also it could be Minecraft itself.

To shine some final light at last minutes:
Ive been messing around with highly formatted books full of server commands, including world edit, and probabbly even some triggering 
JS Macros which triggers Baritone, also beign nearby dozens of command blocks, custom entities, using /title and /playsound alot.

During super crash Ive been running probabbly on Java 11, and with 2 GB ram only.

Feel free to take a look and try to crack this quite unusual event.
If you dont find out yourself, send it to more people, even Mojang themselves if you feel like its really something worth the time)

In worst case, its me who somewhat helped myself in getting into this point... B
ut It' still proof of way to break minecraft way more than anyone would ever anticipated before, which Is also good thing to eventually understand.
(In my decade long career with MC, Ive been breaking this game in all ways possible, so deleting whole .minecraft folder, and even a launcher is no stranger to me, did it countless times, always worked... Always untill today :) 
That made me consider it something possibly worth noting which itself is pretty damn rare and maybe even hard to reproduce

Either way, there is my mystery box of hints in how it all went up.
(IF YOU DETECT SOME INCONSTANCY WITHIN MY LOGS OR OBVIOUS MISTAKES FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON HERE)
(IF YOU EVER NEED ANY EXTRA LOGS FROM WITHIN, HIT ME UP SO I DROP EVERYTHING I HAVE)
If by any chance that turned out to be more complicated than expected, Im able to make iso copy of my whole system + whole chunk of HDD with game so It would
almost guarantee you to be able to reproduce it yourself on virtual machine.
