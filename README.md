# Super-Crash-logs

Long story short.
My minecraft 1.17.1 Aristois got supercrashed apparently as nothing would fix the issue, including dumping .minecraft, reinstalling launcher and fabric.

Logs are given numbers as to order in which they happened.

First log is probabbly the one I got straight after crash happened, second after .minecraft removal, third after launcher reinstall and final after fabric update.

There are two more final logs to give some context.
Launcher terminal output log and Client terminal output log with debug included. both taken recently to paint a picture.

Im not expecting anyone to help me fix it as I bet its as easy as dumping whole /home/ folder in which .minecraft sits in, reinstalling and putting home back to place except all files to replace obiously.

Whole point is to analyse it trougly to determine if:
- Its me who's dumb
- 
- It had something to do with recent mojang exploit (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition)
- as it happened within short time frames betwen. 
- Which could effectively make it one time event, still interesting and worth noting.

- It could also be reproducable and persistent, which would mean huge exploit in one or many different things
- (Fabric, Aristois, Alto Clef, Baritone, JS Macros) was running at the time, also it could be Minecraft itself.

To shine some final light at last minutes:
Ive been messing around with highly formatted books full of server commands, including world edit, and probabbly even some triggering 
JS Macros which triggers Baritone, also beign nearby dozens of command blocks, custom entities, using /title and /playsound alot.

During super crash Ive been running probabbly on Java 11, and with 2 GB ram only.

Feel free to take a look and try to crack this quite unusual event.
